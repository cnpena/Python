#Matrix Multiplication

This program compares two methods of multiplying matrices:<br>
1) Brute Force Method which does O(n^2) operations <br>
2) Divide and Conquer method using Hadamard Matrices <br>

The runtime for both methods is plotted using matplotlib and shown in matmulttime.pdf for matrices up to size 4096 x 4096 <br>
