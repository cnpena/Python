#Sorting Comparison
This program implements Selection sort, Insertion Sort and Merge sort on various arrays and plots the runtimes using Matplotlib. <br>

1) all-sorted.pdf shows the running time of all 3 sorting techniques on already sorted arrays of size 0 to 10,000. (Green = Selection, Blue = Insertion and Red = Merge)<br>
2) all-unsorted.pdf shows the running time of all 3 sorting techniques on reverse sorted arrays of size 0 to 10,000. (Green = selection, Blue = Insertion and Red = Merge) <br>
3) insertion.pdf shows the run time for a sorted array in red and the run time for a reverse sorted array in green. This graph shows that insertion sort runs extremely quickly on a sorted array, even for an array up to size 10,000. However it is very slow with a reverse sorted array. <br>
4) merge.pdf shows the run time for a sorted array in red and the run time for a reverse sorted array in green. This graph shows that Merge Sort works almost equally well on both arrays. Compared to the other two sorts though, this one is much, much more efficient.<br>
5) selection.pdf shows the run time for a sorted array is shown in red and the run time for a reverse sorted array is shown in green. This shows that selection sort runs about the same time on both a sorted and reverse sorted array. <br>
